# GV Team Tool

## Description

This is a tool written for Habitat for Humanity Global Village coordinators. It was created for managing team data on a local server or online. 

![Screenshot 01](/docs/screenshots/01.png)

This tool will give you the ability to record basic trip information and other metadata in order to have more detailed registry and reports. For example, I used R to download team and volunteer participation data from the server and created a report for over 20 years of Global Village in El Salvador. I may link to it in a future version, or you can contact me with any of your questions.

## Features

- Team registry with various metadata fields.
- Volunteer data registry.
- Tracking of volunteers parts of team and volunteer engagement history.
- Advanced search of teams by GV code, dates of trip and status (active/cancelled).
- Advanced filtering of volunteers by name, email address or location.
- Report generation can be limited by date, type of team or name of team.
- Ability to upload and convert images by using the `imagine` PHP image editing tool.

# Project status

This repo is intended to share work with all HFH GV Hosting Teams that need a tool to record and manage their team participation. For the moment no update is intended from my side since I am leaving the organization, so I encourage you to invite developers to work with you on this project, to fork or push some of your updates to this repo, for the benefit of the community.

## Bugs or issues to solve

- User management module: user permissions are hardcoded for now and are still not closed to other users.
- Security management: Due to time, I haven't solved cookie expiration and other security issues.
- Structure: certain tables (officers, translators, regions, projects) are only for use in selection, and not relational.
- Visualizations: reports are just a test at most. Some maps and charts were created by using D3 just to test it out.
- Localization: some parts of the code will have to be edited to fit your country or language.
- Redundancy: filters or ability to merge in order to prevent data redundancy (this could've been useful mostly for legacy data).
